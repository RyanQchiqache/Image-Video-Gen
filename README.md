# Image-Video-Gen

A compact collection of **image and video generative models**, including CNNs, GANs, VAEs, and diffusion-based systems.

This repo serves as a personal playground for building and comparing different generative architectures, from classic deep learning models to modern tools like **Stable Diffusion XL**.

More model families and demos will be added progressively.
